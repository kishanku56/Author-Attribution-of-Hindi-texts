## Author Attribution of Hindi Texts

This project explores **author attribution of online Hindi texts** using conventional machine learning algorithms.  

It was implemented as part of the **B.Tech project requirements**.  

⚠️ **Note:** This may not be the final version of the project. It was our very first attempt at using GitHub — we found it a bit tedious at the time and, admittedly, we were lazy. But as the saying goes, *talent and laziness often go hand in hand*!
